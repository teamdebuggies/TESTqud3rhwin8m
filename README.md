      ## Rationale
      # Architecture Rationale

## Chosen Cloud-Native Patterns and Components
The architecture leverages microservices deployed in AWS to ensure scalability and availability. Key components include:

- **AWS EC2** for compute resources.
- **AWS RDS** for managed database services, ensuring data consistency and availability.
- **AWS S3** for durable storage of logs and backup.
- **AWS CloudFront** for content delivery, reducing latency.
- **AWS Lambda and Kinesis** for event-driven processing, enabling asynchronous processing for reconciliation and settlement.
- **AWS CloudWatch** for robust monitoring and alerting.

## Technology Decisions and Justification
- **Serverless Functions** (AWS Lambda) for event-driven architecture to handle transaction processing asynchronously and reduce bottlenecks.
- **Managed Database** (AWS RDS) for high availability and automated backups.
- **IAM and Security Groups** for fine-grained access control and security compliance aligning with PCI DSS.

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling capabilities and serverless architecture.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go model with minimal management overhead.
- **Security**: In-built security features and compliance with industry standards.
- **Resilience**: High availability and fault-tolerance through managed services.

## Alignment
This architecture aligns with the fintech industry’s needs for secure, scalable, and highly available platforms. It addresses the current latency and reliability issues by leveraging AWS’s robust infrastructure.

      ## Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
      # Architectural Decision Record

## Problem(s) to Solve
Currently, the application faces latency issues, lacks event-driven processing, and does not adhere to industry-standard security measures. There is also limited observability and challenges with scaling during peak loads.

## Analysis Performed
- Analyzed existing architecture and identified potential bottlenecks and points of failure.
- Reviewed AWS services that could address scalability, observability, and security needs.
- Evaluated the use of microservices and serverless architecture.

## Decision and Justification
- Adopted a cloud-native microservices architecture on AWS to address scalability and load handling.
- Implemented event-driven processing via AWS Kinesis and Lambda for efficient transaction handling.
- Utilized AWS CloudWatch for comprehensive monitoring and alerting setup.
- Enhanced security posture using IAM roles and Security Groups to comply with PCI DSS standards.

This decision enhances the platform’s scalability, resilience, security, and observability.
